 *      IMPORTANT: This callback is especially common when using IPv6 because IPv6 uses ICMP
 *      for important network management functions.  For example, IPv6 routers periodically
 *      send out Router Advertisement (RA) packets via Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), which
 *      is implemented on top of ICMP.
